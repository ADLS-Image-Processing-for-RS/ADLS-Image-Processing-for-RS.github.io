:::{.notes}
- Visit <https://www.zhaw.ch/de/lsfm/institute-zentren/iunr/geooekologie/geoinformatik#c121022> to introduce yourself
- These materials will be used as "slides" in class, but are designed to be used to read up on the topics later on
- We will use R to introduce the basics of image processing, since R lends itself to illustrate many basic consepts nicely. 
- Once the concepts are understood, they can be applied to many other programming languages
