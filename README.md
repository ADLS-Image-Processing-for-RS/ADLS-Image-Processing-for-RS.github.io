## Presenter Mode

This Quarto book doubles as both reading material and presentation slides:

- **Normal reading mode**: Standard book layout for student self-study
- **Presenter mode**: Toggle dark theme to add spacing between sections (simulates slides)
- **Speaker notes**: Add `?notes=true` to any URL to show instructor notes

### Usage:

1. **For students**: Use light theme, normal URLs
2. **For teaching**:
   - Switch to dark theme (presenter mode) for slide-like spacing
   - On your laptop: Add `?notes=true` to URL to see speaker notes
   - On beamer: Use normal URL (no notes visible to students)

### Examples:
- Student view: `http://localhost:4200/lesson1-1-tidy.html`
- Instructor view: `http://localhost:4200/lesson1-1-tidy.html?notes=true`

## Notes to self:

- Switching the theme activates the presenter mode
- `quarto preview --profile dev` runs the dev version, with potentially unfinished chapters
- publish using `quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt`
